## Perimeter of squares in a rectangle

### Detail

The drawing shows 6 squares the sides of which have a length of 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.

It's easy to see that the sum of the perimeters of these squares is : `4 * (1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8) = 4 * 20 = 80`

### Examples

###### Example 1

```golang
Perimeter(5) // should return 80
```

###### Example 2

```golang
Perimeter(7) // should return 216
```
